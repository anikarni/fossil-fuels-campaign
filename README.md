# A campaign for climate accountability

According to the [Carbon Majors
Report](https://b8f65cb373b1b7b15feb-c70d8ead6ced550b4d987d7c03fcdd1d.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/cms/reports/documents/000/002/327/original/Carbon-Majors-Report-2017.pdf),
25 companies, listed in this policy, have a significant impact on climate
change. Since 1988, over half the global industrial emmissions have been caused
by their extraction activities. Through this policy, we encourage you to act in
however way you can to ask them to be accountable for their role in climate
change.

Please feel free to contribute and suggest better ways to make this a campaign
worth joining!
